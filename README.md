This project is a robust full-stack e-commerce web application developed using Django as the backend framework and PostgreSQL as the primary relational database for efficient and scalable data management.

It offers a secure and seamless online shopping experience with key features including user registration, login, email verification, and password reset. The platform supports product variations, dynamic cart functionality, and a complete checkout process available to authenticated users. PayPal integration enables secure online payments.

Security is a top priority, with SSL certificate support ensuring encrypted communication over HTTPS, and django-honeypot protecting sensitive forms from bots and automated spam.

The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, using Amazon S3 for managing static and media files, and Route 53 for DNS management. The deployment is managed under the "I Am" AWS IAM user account to maintain strict access control and deployment consistency.
